            <h2>From URL to Interactive</h2>
            <h5>by Aaron Gustafson</h5>
            <p>When we think about it, our whole industry depends on our faith in a handful of "black boxes" few of us fully understand: browsers. We hand over our HTML, CSS, JavaScript, cross our fingers, and hope they render the experience we have in our heads. But knowing how they work can really get you out of a jam when things go wrong. That's why we've assembled a handful of incredibly knowledgeable authors to take us under the hood in this four-part series. Join us on this trip across the web, into the often foggy valley between code and experience.</p>
